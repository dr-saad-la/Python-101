# Lesson: Constants in Python
#
# Description:
# This script introduces constants in Python, explaining the convention
# for naming them, and how they differ from variables. Constants are 
# values that are meant to remain unchanged throughout the program.

def main():
    """
    Main function demonstrating the use of constants in Python.

    Constants are generally written in all uppercase letters, and though Python
    does not have built-in support for constants (unlike other languages), 
    using naming conventions helps signal that certain values should not change.
    
    This function provides examples of defining constants, using them in
    calculations, and explaining best practices.
    
    No arguments or return values.

    # Defining constants: Using uppercase letters and underscores

    # Demonstrating constant usage

    # Using constants in a physics calculation (falling object)

    # Demonstrating a constant that should not change

    # Best Practice: Even though constants can technically be modified, avoid doing so
    # unless absolutely necessary. For example, the following is allowed but not recommended:
    # PI = 3  # This is technically allowed, but it goes against the idea of constants
    # print(f"Modified PI value: {PI}")

    # However, modifying constants may lead to confusion, so always use constants carefully.
    # A better approach is to avoid reassigning or modifying constants once they are set.
