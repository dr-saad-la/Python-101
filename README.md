# Python-101 🐍

**Python-101** is a beginner-friendly project aimed at covering the essentials of Python programming. I have created this repository a series of repositories for teaching Python. I designed this repository to be as friendly as possible with the objective to help anyone who is new to programming or anyone else who just needs a refresher. This project covers the fundamental concepts that you need to get started with Python.
