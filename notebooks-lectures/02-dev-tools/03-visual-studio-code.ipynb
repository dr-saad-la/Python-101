    "       ```bash\n",
    "       pip install pylint\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - VS Code will automatically detect the linter and ask if you want to use it. You can also configure it in `settings.json`:\n",
    "       ```json\n",
    "       \"python.linting.enabled\": true,\n",
    "       \"python.linting.pylintEnabled\": true\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Jupyter Notebook Support**:\n",
    "     - **Overview**: If you work with Jupyter Notebooks, install the **Jupyter** extension for an integrated notebook experience within VS Code.\n",
    "     - **Installation**:\n",
    "       - Search for \"Jupyter\" in the **Extensions View** and click **Install**.\n",
    "       - This extension allows you to run `.ipynb` files directly in VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Prettier & Black for Code Formatting**:\n",
    "     - **Overview**: Prettier and Black are popular code formatters that ensure your Python code is properly formatted and adheres to style guidelines.\n",
    "     - **Installation**: \n",
    "       - Install `black` via pip:\n",
    "         ```bash\n",
    "         pip install black\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "       - In VS Code, enable `black` as the default formatter:\n",
    "         ```json\n",
    "         \"python.formatting.provider\": \"black\",\n",
    "         \"editor.formatOnSave\": true\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Running Python Scripts in VS Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Overview**: You can run Python scripts directly from VS Code, either through the integrated terminal or using the **Run Python File** button.\n",
    "   - **Steps**:\n",
    "     - Open a `.py` file in VS Code.\n",
    "     - Press `F5` to run the file in the debugger, or click the **Run Python File** button in the top right corner.\n",
    "     - To run scripts in the integrated terminal, open the terminal with `Ctrl+`` and type:\n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       python your_script.py\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Configuring Virtual Environments in VS Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Using a virtual environment allows you to isolate dependencies for different projects, preventing conflicts between packages.\n",
    "   - **Steps**:\n",
    "     - Create a virtual environment:\n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       python -m venv venv\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - Activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "       - **Windows**: `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "       - **macOS/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "     - Once activated, VS Code should automatically recognize the environment. If not, use `Python: Select Interpreter` from the command palette to select the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code can be installed on any operating system using different methods, including direct downloads and command-line package managers. Here’s a quick recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Windows** users can leverage `winget`, `choco`, and `scoop` for efficient installation.\n",
    "- **macOS** users can use `brew` for a streamlined setup.\n",
    "- **Linux** users can install using `apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, or download `.deb`/`.rpm` packages directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using command-line tools makes it easy to install, update, and manage your VS Code installation, helping you get started with coding quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting up Python in VS Code involves installing the Python extension, selecting the right interpreter, and adding useful extensions like `Pylance` and `Jupyter`. With these tools, you can leverage VS Code's powerful features to write, debug, and manage Python code more efficiently. The combination of a lightweight editor and a robust set of extensions makes VS Code a powerful IDE for Python development."
